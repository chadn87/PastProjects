PastProjects
============

Past project I have done.

CarGuyTrailer Form(HTML,CSS,Javascript,JQuery) -  form I made for a new company that sells trailers so they could easily and quickly calculate the cost of a trailer. It was designed to be able to work while offline which is why there is a print button for the form and not an email button.

Mapify(Javascript) - a group project I did in a class and it uses the google map API to dynamically map earthquake  and other data.  I contributed the functions to map all the data as well as the zoom modifier and a couple of other modifiers. I also re-arranged almost all of the code for readability.

Pet Simulator(Java) - school project in which I created a text based game where you can feed, walk, bathe a dog.

PrimeNumber(C++) - My first programming project. It takes a file full of numbers and finds all the prime numbers in it.
